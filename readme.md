# JavaScript Training

It will be a lot easier to understand JavaScript if you have basic familiarity with:
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
- any C-like programming language (C, C++, C#, Java, etc).

*Feel free to open a Node REPL or browser console window to follow along. There is no project to do.*

Please read my take on [JavaScript best practices](topics/best-practices.md) if nothing else.
